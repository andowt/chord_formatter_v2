Is on the road again, just can't wait to get on the road again.

The life i love is makin' music with my friends.
        A                        B7             E
And I can't wait to get on the road again.

On the road again, like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
             A                                                    E                  B7
We're the best of friends, insisting that the world keep turnin' our way, and our way.
