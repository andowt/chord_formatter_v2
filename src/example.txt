[Chorus]
E                                                       G#7
On the road again, just can't wait to get on the road again.
                        F#m
The life I love is makin' music with my friends.
        A                        B7             E
And I can't wait to get on the road again.
 
[Verse]
E                                                       G#7
On the road again, going places that I've never been.
                        F#m
Seein' things that I may never see again.
        A                        B7             E
And I can't wait to get on the road again.

        A                                                       E
On the road again, like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
             A                                                    E                  B
We're the best of friends, insisting that the world keep turnin' our way, and our way.
 
[Chorus]
E                                                       G#7

                        F#m
The life i love is makin' music with my friends.
        A                        B7             E
And I can't wait to get on the road again.
